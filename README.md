Encrypt Password in Python using the bcrypt

To encrypt a password in Python, it is recommended to use a secure hashing algorithm instead of encryption.

Encryption is a two-way process, and passwords should be stored in a way that they cannot be easily reversed. Hashing is a one-way process, making it more suitable for password storage.

Hereâ€™s an example using the bcrypt library, which is a popular choice for secure password hashing in Python. You can install it using:

Then, you can use it in your Python code like pws.py file or can  directly downlaod and run.
